High Prio:
  it doesnt exist.
Disruptive Prio:
  anything we want we resolve it manually anyway
Utility Prio:
  - any shot disruptive (block, delay, hijack)
  - regular docs (eventually hurtydoc (fuck strongman tho), others have too much conditions to fully automate it)
  - deflect (which is just doc+vig lol)
  - shot empower/hitmanize/strongmanize (tho avoiding strongman dmg is probably a good idea)
  - mt buff/debuff
  - executes? (idk if we want some i'll have to find a reliable way to check for hp at beginning of the night, otherwise manually)
Damaging Prio:
  - vigs (not nonlethal tho, and overall just avoiding nonlethal dmg is better cause the way we resolve it is weird)
  - any other vig variants so transplant and poison
  - standard shots lol
Low Prio:
  besides info and heals everything else we wanna add has to be done by hand anyway when setting up the sheet
  like motivates or disables or anything that has to do with action submission (thunderdome/blackmail etc)
